    Evan used to smoke cigarettes but one day he was having a smoke with his morning coffee and realized how foul the cigarette tasted. He immediately snuffed it out and threw it in the nearest bin, vowing never to smoke one again. It's now been several years since that fateful morning and he has yet to smoke another cigarette since then. Sense finally caught up to him, although it was a long time coming!
